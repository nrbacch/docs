# My Library

## Managed Plugins

Plugins that can be identified by the Sketchpacks API will be added to the `Managed` view of your Library.

Managed plugins are tracked locally in your Library’s sketchpack JSON file. Providing you with fine-grain control over how your plugins are updated by [setting version ranges and locks](./version-ranges-and-locks). As well as an easy way to [share your plugin collection](./export-plugins.md) with others!

You can find your Library’s sketchpack file at:

```
~/Library/Application\ Support/Sketchpacks/my-library.sketchpack
```

## Unmanaged Plugins

Plugins that can not be identified by the Sketchpacks API will be added to the Unmanaged view of your Library.

Unmanaged plugins are not capable of being updated by Sketchpacks. Unmanaged plugins are never added to your Library’s .sketchpack file.
