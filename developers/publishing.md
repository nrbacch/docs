# Publishing Sketch Plugins

Publishing your plugin to the Sketchpacks Registry can be done in three steps:

1. **Prepare your plugin** for distribution by making sure it has the [essentials](./publishing/essentials.md) needed to be fully searched and discovered.
2. **Install Sketchpacks Relay**, our [Github Integration]({{ book.relayURL }}) that keeps your plugins up-to-date in our registry
3. **Publish release assets** on Github to [serve your plugin](./publishing/releases.md) and it's updates

**Bonus** [Add badges](./publishing/badges.md) to your README.md

That's it!
