# Publishing

Before you publish your plugins, make sure they meet the essential criteria below.

## Essentials

These rules are designed to protect the data integrity of Sketchpacks, and ensure that all plugins can be correctly installed on Sketch.

They also help ensure a baseline, so that all plugins can be easily checked for updates.

* Plugins must use valid semantic versioning
* Plugins must have a valid manifest.json file
* Plugins must have a globally unique identifier

For more information, see the topics below on Semantic Versioning, Plugin Manifests, and Globally Unique Identifiers.

## Best practices

Now that your plugins have met the minimum requirements, letâ€™s go over some ways to increase their exposure on the registry.

* Plugins should have a detailed readme.md file
* Plugins should have a detailed manifest.json file
* Plugins should have tagged releases with change logs
* Plugins should have zipped release assets
