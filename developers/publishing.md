# Publishing

Publishing your plugin to the Sketchpacks Registry can be done in three steps:

1. **Prepare your plugin for distribution** by making sure it has the [essentials](./publishing/essentials.md) needed to be fully searched and discovered.
2. **Install the Sketchpacks Relay Github Integration** at [https://github.com/integration/sketchpacks-relay](https://github.com/integration/sketchpacks-relay)
3. **Select Github repos** containing your plugins that you wish to publish.

That's it!
