# Publishing Plugins with Sketchpacks Relay

Sketchpacks Relay is a Github Integration that connects your plugin repositories
to the registry. When you `push` or `release` changes to your plugin, Sketchpacks
will automatically deliver those updates to your users.

Sketchpacks Relay also helps provide better insights into your plugin's user
activity and retention!

## Getting Started

1. Ensure your plugin meets [the essentials for Sketchpacks](./publishing/essentials.md)
2. Create a [Sketchpacks settings file](./publishing/settings.md) in your repository root directory
3. Install [Sketchpacks Relay]({{ book.relayURL }}) on your plugin repository
