# Publishing Sketch Plugins

Publishing your plugin to the Sketchpacks Registry can be done in three steps:

1. **Prepare your plugin** for distribution by making sure it has the [essentials](./publishing/essentials.md) needed to be fully searched and discovered.
2. **Install Sketchpacks Relay**, our [Github Integration](https://github.com/integration/sketchpacks-relay) that keeps your plugins up-to-date in our registry
3. **Publish release assets** on Github to serve your plugin and it's updates

That's it!
