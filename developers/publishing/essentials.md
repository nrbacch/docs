# Publishing Essentials

These rules are designed to protect the data integrity of Sketchpacks, and ensure that all plugins can be correctly installed on Sketch.

They also help ensure a baseline, so that all plugins can be easily checked for updates.

* Plugins must use valid [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/)
* Plugins must have a [valid manifest.json file](http://developer.sketchapp.com/introduction/plugin-bundles/#manifest)
* Plugins must have a [globally unique identifier](http://developer.sketchapp.com/introduction/plugin-bundles/#identifier)

For more information, see the topics below on Semantic Versioning, Plugin Manifests, and Globally Unique Identifiers.
